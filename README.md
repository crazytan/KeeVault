# KeeForge

A free, native iOS KeePass password manager built with SwiftUI. Read-only in v1 — open any `.kdbx` (KDBX 4.x) database, browse and search entries, copy credentials, and autofill into apps and Safari.

## Features

- **KDBX 4.x** — AES-256 / ChaCha20 decryption with Argon2 key derivation
- **Composite keys** — unlock with password, key file, or both. Supports binary, hex, XML v1/v2 (`.key`/`.keyx`), and arbitrary file key formats
- **Passkey support** — detect and authenticate with FIDO2/WebAuthn passkeys stored in KeePassXC format
- **AutoFill** — credential provider extension works in Safari and apps. QuickType bar suggestions with Face ID
- **TOTP** — live one-time password display with countdown timer
- **Face ID / Touch ID** — biometric database unlock, auto-unlock on launch, biometric-gated password reveal/copy
- **Search** — full-text search across all entries
- **Sorting** — sort by title, created, or modified date; ascending or descending
- **Favicons** — opt-in website icon fetching via DuckDuckGo with disk cache
- **Security hardened** — AES-GCM in-memory secret encryption, exponential backoff on failed attempts, screen recording blur overlay, local-only clipboard, decompression bomb protection, constant-time HMAC comparison

## Requirements

- iOS 17+
- Xcode 16+
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
- Swift 6 (strict concurrency)
- No external SPM dependencies (except Argon2Swift for KDF)

## Build

```bash
xcodegen generate
open KeeForge.xcodeproj
```

Select an iOS 17+ simulator or device, then build and run.

## Usage

1. Open a `.kdbx` database from Files or iCloud Drive
2. Enter master password (and optional key file) to unlock
3. Browse groups, search entries, copy credentials
4. Use AutoFill in Safari and apps — credentials appear in the QuickType bar

## Privacy

KeeForge collects zero data — no analytics, no telemetry, no crash reports. All data stays on device. Network requests are limited to opt-in favicon fetching (domain only, no credentials sent). See [privacy policy](docs/privacy-policy.md).
